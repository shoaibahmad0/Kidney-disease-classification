# Kidney-disease-classification
It is a final year project where i am optimizing a model which is used to classify kidney disease 

Kidney Disease Classification using Deep Learning

A deep learning–based computer vision system for detecting kidney abnormalities (Cyst, Stone, Tumor, Normal) from CT scan images.
Built with YOLOv11 for detection and ResNet + Grad-CAM for classification and explainability, integrated into a Django web app for real-time predictions and history management.



Tech Stack

Languages: Python, HTML, CSS
Frameworks: PyTorch, Django, YOLOv8, TensorFlow
LibrariesL OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Database: SQLite
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git



  Key Features

  YOLOv8 Detection– Localizes kidney abnormalities
  ResNet Classification – Identifies cyst, stone, tumor, or normal
  Grad-CAM Explainability – Highlights disease areas visually
  Django Web App – Upload, predict, and store patient history
  Area Estimation – Calculates affected region in mm²


 Model Performance

| Model    | Accuracy |
| -------- | -------- |
| YOLOv8   | 94.8%    |
